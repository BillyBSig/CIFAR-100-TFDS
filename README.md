# CIFAR 100 Class Image Classification
The CIFAR-100 dataset consists of 60000 32x32 colour images in 100 classes, with 600 images per class. The 100 classes in the CIFAR-100 are grouped into 20 superclasses. Each image comes with a "fine" label (the class to which it belongs) and a "coarse" label (the superclass to which it belongs). There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images. The meta file contains the label names of each class and superclass.
